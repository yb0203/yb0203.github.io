# Reliability & durable execution

SuperFlow is built for mission-critical workloads. Every step in a running SuperFlow is **journaled to durable storage**, every successful step **runs exactly once**, and every in-flight run **survives crashes, restarts, and deployments** without losing work or replaying side effects.

This page explains the guarantees SuperFlow makes, what they mean in practice, and how to configure them.

## The guarantee in one line

> **Once a step in your SuperFlow completes successfully, it will never run again — even if the service restarts mid-flow.**

That's the property that makes SuperFlow safe for billing pipelines, customer-facing automations, multi-day approval flows, and anything else where you can't afford to lose work or double-charge.

## Why durability matters

Without a durable engine, a workflow that crashes halfway through has to either restart from scratch (re-running every step, double-charging customers, re-sending emails) or be manually nursed back to a consistent state (slow, error-prone, doesn't scale).

SuperFlow eliminates the choice. The engine writes a **journal entry** for every meaningful step — every LLM call, every tool call, every HTTP request, every code execution, every loop iteration. If the service is restarted while a SuperFlow is running:

1. The run resumes from where it left off.
2. Already-completed steps **do not re-execute** — their journaled outputs are used directly.
3. Only the in-flight step (and any that come after it) actually run.

This is true for service crashes, planned deployments, infrastructure rotations — anything that takes the runtime down.

## What's durable

The full step-by-step lifecycle is captured:

* **LLM calls** — every model invocation is journaled. On replay, the recorded response is reused; the model is not called again.
* **Tool calls** — every tool invocation. Idempotent or not, a tool that already ran successfully won't be re-fired.
* **HTTP requests** — request and response are captured. No double-POST on retries.
* **Code nodes** — JavaScript execution results are journaled.
* **Pre- and post-processing** — guardrails, memory writes, knowledge-base queries — each step recorded.
* **Loop iterations** — every iteration of a Loop body is recorded individually. A 1000-item loop that crashes on item 743 resumes at 743, not at 1.
* **Sub-workflow calls** — Execute Workflow runs are durably tracked.
* **Approval waits** — HITL approvals can wait days or weeks without consuming resources or losing state.
* **Scheduled triggers** — cron schedules run on crash-safe timers (more below).

## Exactly-once side effects

The combination of "step result is journaled before being returned" and "completed steps are never re-executed" gives you **exactly-once execution** of each step from the engine's point of view.

In plain terms:

* A customer never gets charged twice because the workflow restarted.
* An email never gets sent twice because the LLM call after it failed.
* A downstream API never sees the same POST body twice in a single run.

External systems still control their own idempotency, of course — if you POST to a service that doesn't deduplicate, two separate *runs* of your SuperFlow will both call it. But within a single run, every step is guaranteed to fire at most once.

## Per-node retry on failure

For transient failures — a flaky external API, a model timeout, a momentary network blip — every retryable node can be configured with automatic retries.

In a node's configuration drawer, expand the **Retry** section and toggle **Retry on failure** on. Then set:

* **Max attempts** — how many times the engine will retry before giving up.
* **Wait between attempts** — backoff delay in milliseconds.

Retries are themselves durable. The engine remembers how many times it has tried a step, so retries continue counting correctly even if the service restarts mid-backoff. When the max-attempt count is exceeded, the node fails permanently — at which point you have two options for what happens next.

## Graceful failure with error edges

By default, a permanent node failure (after retries are exhausted) fails the entire run. That's the right behaviour for steps that have to succeed for the workflow to make sense — a critical database write, an LLM call that produces the final answer.

For steps where partial failure is acceptable — or where you want to escalate to a human instead of erroring out — open the node's settings drawer and enable **Handle errors**. The node grows a second output (drawn red) that fires only when the node fails permanently. Wire that error output to a fallback path, a [Wait for Approval](./node-reference#wait-for-approval) for human escalation, or a notification step.

When the node succeeds, the success output fires and the error path stays silent. When it fails permanently, only the error path fires. The rest of the workflow continues either way.

Error edges work *with* retries, not against them — the error output fires after the retry count is exhausted, not on the first failure. See [Error edges](./node-reference#error-edges) for full detail and patterns.

## Long waits cost nothing

Because state lives in durable storage and not in a hot-running process, a SuperFlow that's waiting:

* For a [human to approve](./running-and-approvals#human-in-the-loop-approvals) something
* For a [scheduled trigger](./triggers-and-schedules#schedule-trigger) to fire
* For a [Wait node](./node-reference#quick-reference-table) to elapse

...consumes essentially no resources. A run can wait hours, days, or weeks for an approval without holding a thread or a memory footprint. When the approval comes in (or the scheduled time arrives), the run resumes from exactly where it paused.

This makes SuperFlow viable for slow-by-nature processes — onboarding flows that wait on customer action, escalation paths that wait on managers, periodic syncs that run once a month.

## Lifecycle controls are durable too

The **Pause**, **Resume**, and **Terminate** buttons on a running SuperFlow operate against durable state:

* **Pause** records the request in durable storage. The run stops at the next inter-node boundary and stays paused even if the service restarts.
* **Resume** picks the run up where it stopped — completed nodes stay completed, the next pending node starts fresh.
* **Terminate** cancels the run definitively and marks it cancelled in history. Any in-flight step is cancelled; nothing else runs.

A run can be paused for as long as you want before being resumed, and pause/resume cycles are unlimited.

## Crash-safe scheduled triggers

Cron-based schedules don't rely on a "scheduler process" that has to stay up. Each schedule lives in durable storage and uses **delayed self-sends** — the schedule queues its next tick at creation, and that queued tick survives every kind of outage.

What this means for you:

* A schedule will not "miss a tick" because the service was down at the scheduled moment. When the runtime comes back, queued ticks fire as soon as they're due.

For more on managing schedules, see [Triggers & schedules](./triggers-and-schedules).

## Replay every past run

Every run that has ever executed — successful, failed, paused, cancelled — is preserved with its full per-node output. Open the **History** drawer in the editor to:

* Inspect what every node received and emitted on any past run.
* Re-run the exact same input through the latest version of the SuperFlow.
* Re-run from a specific node to retry only the tail of a failed run (without re-paying for the steps that already succeeded).

This is the production-grade observability layer underneath the engine — you don't need to bolt on logging, span collection, or output capture. It's already there for every run.

## Observability

In addition to per-node JSON outputs in History, SuperFlow emits **OpenTelemetry traces** for every run end-to-end:

* The HTTP request that triggered the run is the root span.
* Each node, each LLM call, each tool call, each pre/post-processing module gets its own span.
* Token counts, model names, providers, durations, and costs are attached as span attributes.

Traces flow into the standard Lyzr trace pipeline alongside agent traces, so a SuperFlow that calls an agent that calls a tool shows up as one continuous trace from trigger to completion.

## Mission-critical checklist

If you're putting a SuperFlow on a production path, here's a short checklist:

* **Configure retries** on every node that calls an external system (HTTP Request, AI Agent, Tool nodes). 3 attempts with exponential backoff is a reasonable default.
* **Use Wait for Approval** for any step with irreversible real-world side effects (payments, customer-facing emails, deletions). Pair it with a clear approval message that contains the relevant upstream context.
* **Turn on error edges** for nodes where graceful degradation is preferable to failing the whole run — fallback API calls, per-iteration recovery inside a Loop, escalations into a Wait for Approval node.
* **Lock down webhook secrets.** If your trigger is a webhook, rotate the secret on team changes and never commit it to source.
* **Watch executions in History** while rolling out a new SuperFlow. Live monitoring + replay together catch issues fast.
* **Schedule with a buffer.** For cron-based workloads, leave room for retries and downstream slowness so a slow run doesn't overlap with the next tick.

## What this enables

The combined result is that you can build SuperFlows that:

* Pay invoices.
* Send customer-facing communication.
* Run for days or weeks waiting on humans.
* Survive restarts, deployments, and infrastructure events without operator intervention.
* Are observable end-to-end without setting up tracing yourself.

These are not just convenience features — they're the difference between a workflow tool that's safe in production and one that isn't.
